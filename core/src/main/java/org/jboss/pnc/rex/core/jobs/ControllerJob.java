/**
 * Template for creating Controller Jobs. Usually a ControllerJob is associated with a specific Task which triggered
 * said Job.
 *
 * Each Controller Job has to have a TransactionPhase defined. TransactionPhase will determine in which transaction
 * phase the Job is run (f.e. a Job should be executed only after a successful Transaction or a Job has to be executed
 * within the bounds of the Transaction which scheduled the Job). Jobs that run after Transactions have to handle fault
 * tolerance (Retries) and creating new transactions on their own.
