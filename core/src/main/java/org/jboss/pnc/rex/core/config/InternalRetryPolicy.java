            Fault Tolerance Policy (mainly Retries) that maintains consistency
            of data in Infinispan. In case a transaction fails (concurrent modification), it is
            automatically retried from the earliest point where data was accessed.
            Newly spawned transaction will do the same operations but with up-to-date
            data. Therefore the operation/action is not lost and data should be consistent.
