/**
 * This enum represent Transition between States
 * <p>
 * Transition is a process where there could be a number of Jobs that need to be executed before a transition is
 * completed. Another transition cannot be initiated until these tasks are completed.
 * <p>
 * F.e. Transition between UP and STOP_REQUESTED State creates a Job for each dependant Task to stop and another Job to send a
 * request to remote entity to stop the Task's remote execution. After these Jobs are completed, Task can complete its
 * Transition to STOPPED/STOP_FAILED (based on remote entity's response).
 * <p>
 * Transition is an edge in state-machine diagram.
